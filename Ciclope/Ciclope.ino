/*******************************************************************
  SoftServo sketch for Adafruit Trinket.  Turn the potentiometer knob
  to set the corresponding position on the servo 
  (0 = zero degrees, full = 180 degrees)
 
  Required library is the Adafruit_SoftServo library
  available at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SoftServo
  The standard Arduino IDE servo library will not work with 8 bit
  AVR microcontrollers like Trinket and Gemma due to differences
  in available timer hardware and programming. We simply refresh
  by piggy-backing on the timer0 millis() counter
 
  Required hardware includes an Adafruit Trinket microcontroller
  a servo motor, and a potentiometer (nominally 1Kohm to 100Kohm
 
  As written, this is specifically for the Trinket although it should
  be Gemma or other boards (Arduino Uno, etc.) with proper pin mappings
 
  Trinket:        USB+   Gnd   Pin #0  Pin #2 A1
  Connection:     Servo+  -    Servo1   Potentiometer wiper
